still needed? *Implement the franchise class.
                  -In the Franchise class, put the history of team logos in chronological order.
*here's a thought: when determining which stadium to get the numbers on when the user does not select a neutral site; if it's a single team vs the league simulation, the user should have the option if they want that team to always be home, always be away, or split the games up somehow.

 -> These are on the pitcher
    *balks should be a percentage and checked on each pitch when runners are on base
        -balks/(# of pitches thrown) * 2 <-- 2 comes from half stretch, half windup (roughly)
    *wild pitches should be a percentage and checked on each pitch when runners are on base (with no runners are on, it's just a ball)
        -wp/(# of pitches thrown) * 2 <-- 2 comes from half stretch, half windup (roughly)

 -> This is on the catcher
    *passed balls should be a percentage and checked on each pitch when runners are on base (with no runners are on, it's just a ball)
        -pb/(# of pitches caught) * 2 <-- 2 comes from half stretch, half windup (roughly)
