*allow the user to save the ouput of any given simulation if desired.
*make advanced stats.
*make pitching changes.
	-keep track of pitch counts.
	-calculate the number of pitchers per outing for each pitcher.
*determine which fielder makes each play.
*allow users an option to simulate a season for two teams against each other.
	-or one team against the league like an actual season.
	                                or against the league average team.
	-Idea: two teams against each other: switch home and away after 81 games.
*All output should be interactive (sort, filter, etc.)
*allow for the user to change a pitcher's numbers or a fielder's numbers in the adjust player attributes window.
still needed? *Implement the franchise class.
                  -In the Franchise class, put the history of team logos in chronological order.
still needed? *add a list of keyboard commands to the help menu.
*make an option for the user to not allow a player to be in the lineup.
	-If player x from team A is added to team B and the two teams play against one another, prompt the user and ask them if they want player x on team A as well as team B.
*here's a thought: when determining which stadium to get the numbers on when the user does not select a neutral site; if it's a single team vs the league simulation, the user should have the option if they want that team to always be home, always be away, or split the games up somehow.
*add a gui to show the user the progess of the simulation (other than the progress bar).
*add a progress bar to the SearchInterface.
*figure out what kind of error the "statistics.StatisticsError: no unique mode; found 2 equally common values" error is.
*problem with baseballReference.com: they are missing a games from DET & CHW 1979 season.
	-Found here: https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DET/1979-lineups.shtml
	-Found here: https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1979-lineups.shtml
*add fielding stats to careerProfile.
*create batting orders and pitching rotations for all teams from 1907-1876.
	-Do this using some kind of comparison algorithm using data that's already present.
*change player positions that say "OF" to be more specific.
*add a way for a team from before 1973 to include a DH in their lineup if they're playing in an American League park after 1972.
still an issue? *here's a problem, david ross played 11 games for the padres in 2005, but that doesn't show up on his career profile.
*here's a problem, pitchers who were kept in the game at some other position to face a hitter later have that position listed as a position they play.
	-See 2016 cubs full roster.
*if the user selects the "switch home and away", make sure it switches everything else that needs switched (e.g. additionalPlayers, etc.).
*make a part of player and career profile show graphs about things like gb/fb (pie), at bat outcomes (pie), production over time (line), etc.
*make a way to rank franchise years to see best years for each franchise based on finish, stats, year weights, etc.
*make a way to compare players to other players in different eras based on stats, position, skillset, tendencies, etc.
	-e.g. who is Mike Trout's comp from the 1920's?
*when simulating, determine if a ball is in play or not, if so gb, fb or line drive; then determine outcome from that.
*when simulating, if the two teams are the same, just get their team_info once from the database. this db call is 0.60 seconds on average (creating a team's lineup for a game takes seconds on average).

**convert everything over to GSDB:
    *adjust home park numbers for the team's pitching staff that year.
        -Think this is done, check!
    *Create a way to get the comps for players from any specified decade.
        -Only get players from these years to use as possible_comps.
        -Create an aggregate number for each player in the decade for how close they are to the given player, then
            subtract from the max in that list and multiply by the number of years that the possible_comp played
            during that decade to weight by favoring those who played in more years (larger sample size = more
            confident comparisons).
        -Set a minimum number of years for players that can be comparisons (e.g. player must have played 5+ year in this decade to be a possible comp).
    *Find out when mlbam data is updated, if in real time then I can created a real time view similar to fantasycast.

-Restart everything with concurrency, and make it clean in terms of folder hierarchy.
    *determine if teamRanker_ovr is correct or not.
        -Maybe decrease the amount which standard deviation affects team rankings in overall team ranker.
    *verify that player_batting, player_pitching and player_fielding numbers are accurate.
    *aggregate and consolidate pitch_fx data.
        -When aggregating, pitch_fx records should relate only to TOT if player played on multiple teams that year.
            -The data for players who fit this category will have their pitches written to their teams and not TOT.
    *add way to delete data from given years through reset_database.py
    *add a way to migrate data from sandbox databases to production databases.
        scenarios tested:
            *migrate all baseballData from sandbox to production.
            *migrate all baseballData for a single year.
        scenarios that need to be tested:
            *migrate all baseballData for a range of years. (check)
            *migrate all pitchers_pitch_fx from sandbox to production.
            *migrate pitchers_pitch_fx from a single year.
            *migrate pitchers_pitch_fx from a range of years.
            *migrate all batters_pitch_fx from sandbox to production.
            *migrate batters_pitch_fx from a single year.
            *migrate batters_pitch_fx from a range of years.

-WebApp
    *look into SQL injection protection
    *test "remember me" functionality
    *check out other websites for ideas

restart code on server by deleting existing code and pulling from git.
